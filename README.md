# College Kings Translation Files

DO NOT EDIT MAIN BRANCH

### How to make a new language:
 - Create a new branch for your language, name it after your language and copy the base files from main.
 - Rename every "lang_base_translation" to the language name you are translating to.
 - If you need help with anything else, just ask Jany on discord.
 
### How to update your language:
 - Make a pull request from the main branch to your language branch.
 - If it doesn't merge automatically, contact Jany on discord.

### How ton track your progress:
 - Fill in the table below when pushing the new translation to github.
 - If you work together with other poeple, make sure to check what they are working on to not translate files twice.
